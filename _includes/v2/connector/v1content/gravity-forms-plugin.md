### Prerequisites

You must have the following before you begin:

- WordPress with Gravity Forms installed
- Admin access to install WordPress plugins
- A Cyclr account
- Cyclr [Gravity Forms Plugin](https://cyclr.com/integrate/gravity-forms-plugin) connector installed

### Download

Once you have confirmed the above, download our Gravity Forms plugin.

[Download Cyclr Gravity Forms Plugin](http://files.cyclr.com/cyclr-plugins/cyclr-webhooks.zip)

### Installation

1.  In WordPress, click **Plugins**
2.	Click **Add New**
2.  On the Add Plugins page, click **Upload Plugin**
3.  Find the zip file for the plugin on your computer and upload

Once those steps are complete, setup the plugin.

### Get webhook URL from Cyclr

- Create a cycle and install the Gravity Forms Plugin connector
- Click/drag the **Form Entry** step into the builder
- Click the cog icon on the step
- Copy the webhook's URL to your clipboard; this is where your form will post its data

### Set up Gravity Forms

- In Gravity Forms, open your form for editing
- Add a new hidden field to your form named **WebhookUrl**
- On the field's Advanced tab, set the Default Value to be the webhook URL generated by your step in Cyclr

#### Conditional Logic
If you are using Conditional Logic to show/hide fields, you need the hidden field **WebhookUrl** above all fields which have Conditional Logic. 

We recommend adding **WebhookUrl** to the very top of your form.

### Set up custom fields in Cyclr

Cyclr does not know the fields added to your form by default. You will need to add these in Cyclr.

Add fields via a dummy form submission, or manually via the builder

#### Dummy form submission

- Click the **Field Discovery** button on your Form Entry Step in your cycle
- Make a dummy submission of your form
- Cyclr waits for a submission 
- Cyclr parses the submission and creates new Custom Fields

#### Manual field addition
To manually add Fields or to change existing ones, follow these steps:
- Go to the builder
- Open the connector in the sidebar 
- Click the **Settings** button
- Under **Methods & Fields** click the **Entries** category
- Click the **Form Entry** webhook
