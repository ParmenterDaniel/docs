### Automating Pipedrive

#### Automating Deals

Our Pipedrive connector includes a number of webhooks. These are real-time event notifications that fire when something happens to a deal, e.g. when one is created or updated.

Example uses:

- Sync new deals with another system
- Trigger time-based actions for deals stuck at a certain stage
- At key deal stages, add the associated contacts to a marketing system
- Automate internal Pipedrive deals, e.g. when a deal hits a certain stage move it to a different pipeline

##### Deal stage lookups

One of the keys to using Pipedrive's deals is working with the Stage ID in a Cyclr Decision step. In doing this, you can trigger the next appropriate action, either in Pipedrive or in another app.

#### Forms

With Cyclr, you can integrate Pipedrive with a number of form building apps including:

- Contact Form 7
- Gravity Forms
- Typeform
- SurveyMonkey

#### Automate Your Sales Pipeline

Cyclr lets you automate your sales process by using webhooks and triggers based on movements between pipeline stages.

Example uses:

- Send deals to separate pipelines for other teams to complete work on

- Automatically send emails and messages when a deal hits a particular stage

### Pipedrive and Contact Form 7 Integration

Getting Contact Form 7 to work with your Pipedrive CRM has been a pain for a long time, so you'll be please to see that you can connect the two with Cyclr.

#### Why Integrate Contact Form 7 and Pipedrive?

Contact Form 7 is still one of the most popular form building applications around. While it's name suggest it is just for contact forms, it has many usages when combined with Pipedrive, including:

- Adding new website enquiries directly into your CRM
- Creating new deals direct from forms
- Managing helpdesk enquiries
- Passing user registration data across your company's application stack

Cyclr's Intercom connector contains a range of webhooks that can be triggered when an event criteria in Intercom is met. Take a look at the video guide below to see how you can set it up.
