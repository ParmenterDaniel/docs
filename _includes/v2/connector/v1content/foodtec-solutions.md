## Partner Setup

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

The FoodTec Solutions connector authentication requires :
- the name of the chain you wish to interact with
- an `API Key`

Yor account URL includes the chain, for example:
  > https://**{ChainName}**.foodtecsolutions.com

Your `API Key` (token) is issued by FoodTec Solutions. Contact your FoodTec Solutions account manager if you need help to get this.
