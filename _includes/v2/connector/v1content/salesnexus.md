## Partner Setup

The SalesNexus connector is authenticated with an `API Key` (authorization token).

You can use the  methodology in the following section to obtain a temporary `API Key` within the connector. 

The temporary `API Key` will expire after an unspecified amount of time, resulting in failed calls to the SalesNexus API. 

If you require a permanent `API Key` that will not expire (recommended), please contact SalesNexus support.
