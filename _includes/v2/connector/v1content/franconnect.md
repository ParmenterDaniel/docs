## Cyclr Setup

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

In Cyclr's Connector Setup, enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

The `Company Code` is the part after "https://" and before "/fc" of the login URL.

For example, for a login URL for your FranConnect system is `https://developers.franconnect.net/fc`,  the company code is `developers.franconnect.net`.

Login to the FranConnect account using the details provided and the connector is authenticated.
