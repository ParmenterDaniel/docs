Here are the key points from that documentation:

- The user must have  **API Access** permission.
- Before logging into an account, the account must have the API feature enabled, and must have at least one API token created.
- If you have a Professional or Core edition account, you can create and edit API tokens by going to **Settings > Platform Settings > Data Exchange** in the platform. \
 \- or - \
Multi-Brand edition clients, and clients with certain versions of the Agency edition can create and edit tokens able to access all your accounts or a specific account. To create and edit API tokens in a Multi-Brand account, go to **Settings > Platform Settings > Data Exchange** at the Multi-Brand level.
