## Partner Setup

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

To authenticate the Oracle Eloqua connector, you need a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

To setup your Oracle Eloqua app, you need your Cyclr service domain:
- Login to your Cyclr console
- Go to Settings > General Settings > Service Domain
- Note your `Service Domain`

To get these:

1. Enter your Eloqua instance
2. Go to **Settings > Platform Extensions > AppCloud Developer**
2. Click  **Create App**
3. Enter a name, description, the address of an icon for your app
4. For the callback URL, enter `https://[Service Domain]/connector/callback`
5. Click **Save** - you do not need to Add Services.
6. You will recieve a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
