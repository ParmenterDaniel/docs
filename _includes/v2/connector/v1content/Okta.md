## Partner Setup

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

To set up the Okta Connector, your user needs an `API Token`.

To create an `API Token`:

1. Sign in to their Okta organization as a user with administrator privileges
2. Access the API page: In the Admin Console, select **API** from the Security menu and then select the Tokens tab
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Name the token and click **Create Token**
5. Note the `API Token` - this is the only opportunity to see it

Use this token to authenticate the Okta Connector within Cyclr.

See [the Okta authentication documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) for more information.
