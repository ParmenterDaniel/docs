To authenticate the Aircall connector, you will need an ``api_id`` and an ``api_token``.

To obtain these, go to your Company's Settings page in Aircall. In the API Keys section, click on **Add a new API key** and get your ``api_id`` and ``api_token``.

You can now use these to authenticate the connector, passing the API ID and API Token as username and password respectively.
