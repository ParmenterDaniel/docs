## Partner Setup

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

Login to your existing Lizzy account.

### API Key

To use the Lizzy API, the customer must grant you access. 

Refer your Lizzy customers to the video Interface Setup Procedures (1.9) [Controlling Who Has Access To Your Data](https://youtu.be/zJbWNx4_rI4)

This video shows how to set up a contact to access the API.

**NB**: To make calls on behalf of more than one Lizzy customer, you need a different `API Key` for each dealership or company. Lizzy uses them to determine which company you are working with.

API Keys are IP restricted: you must [whitelist Cyclr's IP address](https://docs.cyclr.com/cyclr-ip-allowlist).
