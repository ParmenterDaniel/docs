## Post Leads Method

Calls to the Post Leads method require the name of the Campaign to which the lead should be added.  

You can check these values by:

1. Go to your LeadMailbox dashboard
2. Click `Settings`
1. Click `Campaigns`
3. Click [`Campaign Name`]
4. Click `Show Post Url`

This shows the values to be used for both the Account Name and the Campaign Name.
