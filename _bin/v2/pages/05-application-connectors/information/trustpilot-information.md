## Additional information

You will need a 'Business Unit ID' for most requests, without it you will receive a '403 - Forbidden' response. The recommended way of obtaining that is by using the 'Search For Business Units' method as the first step in your cycles.

It is worth noting that some endpoints are classified as Private by Trustpilot. This means that the logged in user must have permissions to access that Business Unit ID's data. If the logged in user does not have those permissions you will receive a '403 - Forbidden' response.
