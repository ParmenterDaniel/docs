## Additional information

The Adestra system has the concept of tables some method calls require a table ID. You can call the List Core, and List Data table methods to find the ID.

The contact methods have the default ID and Email specified; you can add custom fields as specified on the method for the required table. The table definition can be downloaded from the Adestra portal or via the connector table methods.
