## Additional Information

### Custom Entity category

You can create custom object categories that allow you to access custom object data. To do this:

1. On the connector setup page, click on the **Custom Entity** category to expand it.
2. Click on the pink **Copy this Category to create a Custom Object Category** button.
3. In the **Specify object name** field, type in the object that you would like to retrieve the data from. This needs to be the exact name of the object, for example, "Users".
4. Click **Copy** to create the custom object. A dialogue appears to confirm it has been created.
5. The custom category created appears in your **Methods & Fields** list.

You can use this to list and retrieve individual objects based on the entered name of the custom object. More information can be found [here](https://docs.cyclr.com/enhanced-objects).
