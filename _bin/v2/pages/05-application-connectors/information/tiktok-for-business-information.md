### TikTok for Business sandbox account setup

TikTok for business has sandbox account functionality for testing. You can find TikTok for Business's guide on how to set this up [here](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738855331457026). Make note of the **Access Token** generated when doing this as it will be needed when installing the sandbox installation version of the connector.
