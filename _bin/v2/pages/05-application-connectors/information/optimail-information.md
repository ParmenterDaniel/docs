### Retrieving Campaign IDs

The methods under `Subscriptions` require a Campaign ID, there is no way to retrieve these via the API. the Campaign ID is obtained via the Optimail portal. 

Within the Optimail portal:
  * Select `Campaigns` in the page header.
  * Select the campaign for which you wish to retrieve the ID.
  * On the campaign page you will see `CAMPAIGN API ID` field in the bottom left of the page.
