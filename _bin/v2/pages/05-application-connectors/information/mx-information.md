## Creating custom Institution objects

Once the connector is authenticated, you can create custom `Institution` objects. This will automatically populate request and response fields for methods within the custom object. To create a custom object:

1. Go to the **Edit Connector** page for the MX connector.
2. Under the **Methods & Fields** heading, locate the **Institutions** category and select it to expand.
3. Select the red **Copy this Category to create a Custom Object Category** icon.
4. Use the dropdown menu to select the required `Institution`.
5. Select **Copy**.
6. This process can be repeated for any number of available `Institutions`.

Methods in the newly created custom category will now run against the specified `Institution`.
