## Utilising Custom Object Categories

The methods within some categories (like Tables) require you to create a custom object category. This is to create a clearer user experience when creating cycles.

In Cyclr:

1. Go to My Connectors.
2. Select Capsio.
3. When some categories are expanded (to reveal their methods) a copy button will appear below the category name.
4. Once you press this button, you will be able to select which item to create the Custom Category for (For example a specified Table).
5. Now when you return to your Cycle editor, you will see the new category (marked with a star), which will automatically connect with the object that was assigned to it.
