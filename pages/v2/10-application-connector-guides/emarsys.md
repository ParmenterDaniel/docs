## Authentication ##

To authenticate the connector you will need a username and secret key.  To obtain these you will need to create an API user within Emarsys.

There are instructions for doing so here: https://dev.emarsys.com/v2/before-you-start/overview#creating-api-users

Once you have the username and secret, you can use them to authenticate the connector.
