## Connector Setup

To setup the connector you will need a **Partner Name** and **Request Token**, both of which should be provided by Insider.

1. Locate the Insider connector in the Cyclr console.

   > Cyclr Console > Connectors > Connector Library > Insider

2. Click the open padlock and on the next page enter the **Partner Name** and API Key (your Insider **Request Token**).

The connector is now authenticated and ready to use.
