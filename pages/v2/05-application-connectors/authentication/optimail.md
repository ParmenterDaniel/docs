Connector Setup
---------------

In order to setup the connector you will first need to retrieve your API key from Optimail.

To do this:
 * Log in to your Optimail account.
 * Select the `Integrations` option in the header of the page.
 * Select `API Key & Integration Guide`, and on this page you will see a field labeled `Account API ID`.
