# Dynamics CRM Custom Objects Connector Setup

This connector is designed to work with a single custom entity. When working with more than one, you must install a separate Dynamics CRM connector for each custom entity type.

### Installation

For details on how to authenticate this connector, review the [how to install the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector](dynamics-crm-online.md) guide as the Connectors use the same setup. See the image below for an example:

When setting up the connector you will also have to enter the names of the custom entity set and custom entity type you wish to interact with.
