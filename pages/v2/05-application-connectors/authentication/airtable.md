## Airtable setup

You need an API key, Base ID and table name from Airtable to use the Airtable connector in Cyclr:

*  To get the API key, go to the Airtable [account page](https://airtable.com/account) and copy of the API key from the **API** section.
*  To get the Base ID, go to the [API](https://airtable.com/api) section in Airtable and select the table base you want to use. Copy the BaseID from the **Introduction** section.
*  The table name is the name of the table in the base (**not** the name of the base).

## Cyclr account setup

Cyclr asks you for the below values when you install the <connector name> connector into an account:

| Value              | Description                                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------   |
| **API key**        | Your Airtable API key.                        |
| **BaseID**         | The BaseID of the base you want Cyclr to use. |
| **Table name**     | The name of the table you want Cyclr to use.  |

You can test the connector in one of your Cyclr accounts if you call a method to confirm it can return some data.
