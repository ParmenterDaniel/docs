## Briostack Setup

In order to authenticate the connector, you will simply need your username, password and account name.

Your account name can be found in the address of your website, for example if your site is __johnsmithltd.briostack.com__, your account name would be __johnsmithltd__.

### Note

The Briostack API requires a separate account for each installation of the connector.  If you try to run two connectors authenticated with the same details, you may receive the following error -

``"Congratulations! It looks like your team is growing and you need more Brio Sales licenses. Reach out to Briostack at 801-623-5200 or support@briostack.com to add more."``
