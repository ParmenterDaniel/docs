## Authentication

To authenticate the OpenCRM connector you will need an **API Key**, **Pass Key** and your OpenCRM account name.

### API Key and Pass Key

These credentials should be issued by OpenCRM's support team or your OpenCRM account manager. Please contact support@opencrm.co.uk for more information.

### OpenCRM Account

This is your account name as it appears in the url when logged into OpenCRM. For instance if the url is https://<span>mycompany.</span>opencrm.co.uk your account name for the API purposes would be **mycompany**.

### Connector Setup

   > Cyclr Console > Connectors > Connector Library > OpenCRM

2. From the Edit Connector interface click 'Setup'

3. Enter your Pass Key and OpenCRM account name, click 'Next'

4. Enter your API Key, click 'Next'

The connector is now authenticated and ready to use.
