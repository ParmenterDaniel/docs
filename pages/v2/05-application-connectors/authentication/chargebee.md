## Partner Setup

### Setting up your Account

To authenticate the connector you need your Chargebee [Domain name](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/sites-intro.html) and [API Key](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/api_keys.html).

You will obtain your Domain name once you've signed up to Chargebee. A "Complete Account Setup" email will be sent to your email ID. Click the link in the email to setup your password and domain name.

Once you've signed into your account you will be able to get your API Key by selecting 'Settings' > 'Configure Chargebee' > 'API Keys and Webhooks' > 'API Keys'. Any existing API keys are listed.

For further information setting up API Keys, please see the [Official Chargebee documentation](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/api_keys.html).
