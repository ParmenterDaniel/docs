## Retrieve Campaign IDs

The methods under **Subscriptions** require a Campaign ID. You can't obtain the Campaign ID through an API call, so you need to go to the Optimail portal: 

1. Select **Campaigns** in the page header.
2. Select the campaign you need the ID for.
3. Copy the `CAMPAIGN API ID` field in the bottom left of the Campaign page.
