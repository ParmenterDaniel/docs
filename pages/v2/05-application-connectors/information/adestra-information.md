## Tables

Because the Adestra system has tables, some method calls require a table ID. You can call the **List Core**, and **List Data** table methods to find the ID.

The contact methods have the default ID and Email specified; you can add custom fields as specified on the method for the required table. You can download the table definition from the Adestra portal or via the connector table methods.
