## Additional information

This connector has some unique functionality:

- To edit contacts you are required to use the 'Accounts' methods and edit the contact within an account. It has been advised that you have a maximum of one contact per account.
- To add custom-fields, you have to add them manually to each method. The field needs to be attached to it's corresponding object. If your custom field is on an account, your Field Location would be 'account.{{FieldLocation}}'.
