## Notes

This connector has some unique functionality:

- To edit contacts, you can use 'Accounts' methods and edit the contact within an account. For you to edit contacts this way, you need a maximum of one contact per account.
- To add custom fields, you need to add them manually to each method. You need to attach the field to its corresponding object. For example, if your custom field is on an account, your** Field Location** is 'account.{{FieldLocation}}'.
