## Custom Entity category

You can create custom object categories that allow you to access custom object data:

1. On the connector setup page, select the **Custom Entity** category to expand it.
2. Select the pink **Copy this Category to create a Custom Object Category** button.
3. In the **Specify object name** field, type in the object that you want to retrieve the data from. Make sure you enter the exact name of the object, for example, `Users`.
4. select **Copy** to create the custom object. 

A dialogue appears to confirm that you created the custom object and the custom category created appears in your **Methods & Fields** list. You can use this to list and retrieve individual objects based on the entered name of the custom object. For more information, see the Cyclr documentation on [enhanced objects](https://docs.cyclr.com/enhanced-objects).
