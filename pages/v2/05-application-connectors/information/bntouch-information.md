## Create a Lead

When you create a Lead, you need to enter the ID of the schema that you use. The schema specifies how the data will be posted to the BNTouch API. For more information on where to find the schema, contact your BNTouch account manager. 

Although all request fields are marked as optional, you need to populate at least one field for the request to succeed. When you successfully submit a Lead, you receive a status of 'ACCEPTED'.
