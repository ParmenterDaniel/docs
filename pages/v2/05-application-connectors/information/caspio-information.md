## Utilize custom object categories

The methods in some categories, such as tables, require you to create a custom object category. Custom object categories create a clearer user experience when you create cycles.

To create a custom object category, go to your Cyclr console:
1. Go to **My Connectors**.
2. Select **Capsio**.
3. Expand a category so the **copy** button appears below the category name, and select **copy**.
4. Select which item to create the custom category for.

When you return to your Cycle editor, it shows the new category marked with a star. The new category automatically connects with the object that you assigned to it.
